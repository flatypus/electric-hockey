What is this?
Essentially, this is based on the phet simulation for electrostatics hockey. I took the concept and tried to build a multiplayer game out of it using socket.io and nextjs. You control your character with the mouse in a 800x400 map, and try to score a positively charged ball into a goal. You can press space to switch charges instantaneously, creating some interesting gameplay for an otherwise deathly boring concept.
